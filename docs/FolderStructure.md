
Folders here are pretty simple:
* bin -> compiled binaries
* common -> code that gets included into the engine *and* games/plugins, containing interfaces and some common utility classes
* docs -> specifications, some explanations & guides; brief, surface-level explanations
	* Note that the actual API reference and stuff will be hosted elsewhere and is currently not a thing
* engine -> implementations of said interfaces in common (e.g. `IEngine` -> `Engine`)
* extern -> all the external dependencies
